        <h2>2. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>

        <h3>Data Protection</h3>
        <p>
          The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Information about the Responsible Party</h3>
        <p>
          The responsible party for data processing on this website is:
        </p>
        <p>
          Symetics GmbH<br>
          Lohmühlenstraße 65<br>
          12435 Berlin<br>
          Germany
        </p>
        <p>
          Phone: +49 30 / 75437336<br>
          Email: info@angular.de
        </p>
        <p>
          The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).
        </p>

        <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. An informal message by email is sufficient for the revocation. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>

        <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
        <p>
          If data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims (objection under Art. 21(1) GDPR).
        </p>

        <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Supervisory Authority</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
        </p>

        <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
        </p>

        <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
        <p>
          This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
        </p>
        <p>
          If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Information, Blocking, Deletion</h3>
        <p>
          Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction, blocking or deletion of this data at any time. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint for this and other questions on the subject of personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data Collection on Our Website</h2>

        <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
        <p>
          The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
          <li>Operating system used</li>
          <li>Referrer URL</li>
          <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
          <li>Time of the server request</li>
          <li>IP address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data is not merged with other data sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The basis for data processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.
        </p>

        <h3>Contact Form</h3>
        <p>
          If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provide there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of the data entered in the contact form is therefore based exclusively on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time. An informal message by email is sufficient for the revocation. The legality of the data processing operations carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular retention periods – remain unaffected.
        </p>
